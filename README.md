# Personal Website
  I built this website to showcase myself.

# Technologies used:
 * React
 * React-Icons
 * EmailJS to send contact email
 * React-lottie-player for animations
 * TailwindCSS
  
 
# What did I learn
  This was my big step forward in understanding and creating a more modern UI.
  This was my first project using lottie as well, I really enjoyed using the animations.
  I also learned how to use the EmailJS api to send an email to my set email when a visitor sends the form.
  
# Hurdles Overcome
  * Creating a stylish and inviting UI.
  * Making the website responsive.
